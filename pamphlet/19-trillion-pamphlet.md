### **The Revelation**
Australia's balance sheet reveals we're worth **$19 trillion**.

*What if we shared what we already have?*

✅ **$800 per week** for every person  
✅ **Housing credits** for mortgage offset or rent  
✅ **5+ years** of guaranteed income  
✅ **Zero** poverty or homelessness

### **How It Works**
**Step 1**: Create Sovereign Wealth Conversion Fund  
**Step 2**: Issue Digital Civic Shares to every Australian  
**Step 3**: Weekly distributions through existing payment systems  

*Implementation time: Under 5 minutes of Parliamentary voting*

💰 **$6.3 trillion unlocked** from existing national wealth  
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **$2,000+ weekly** for average family of four

### **Addressing Your Concerns**

**"Won't this cause inflation?"**  
No - payments are asset-backed, not debt-created. Weekly distribution prevents market shocks.

**"Will people stop working?"**  
UBI pilots show labor participation remains steady. People leave bad jobs, not all jobs.

**"Is this financially sustainable?"**  
Yes - backed by $19 trillion in real assets, not borrowed money.

**"How quickly could this happen?"**  
Parliament could approve and implement in a single session.

### **The Vision**
*"A child born tomorrow will never know poverty, homelessness, or fear random violence."*

This isn't a dream. It's a mathematical certainty when we share what we already possess.
