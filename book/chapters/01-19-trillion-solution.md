# Chapter 1: The $19 Trillion Solution

## 1. A National Reset

Australia holds approximately $19 trillion in national wealth. This chapter explores how leveraging just a fraction of this wealth can erase all public debts, secure government funding for the next five years, and provide every citizen with the assets and income required for a stable future.

### Debt Eradication
- Federal and state debts totaling approximately $786.815 billion can be cleared instantly.
- This act not only stabilizes the economy but also redirects resources previously allocated to debt servicing.

### Government Prepayment
- Covering approximately $1.0582 trillion annually, all government functions can be pre-funded for five years, amounting to $5.29 trillion.

### Redistribution Balance
- After stabilizing the financial ecosystem and securing governmental operations, $12.92 trillion remains for direct citizen allocation.

## 2. Universal Redistribution

### Adults (20 and over)
- **25%**: $104,000 in income-producing assets such as business shares or ownership.
- **25%**: $104,000 allocated for housing security.
- **50%**: Weekly income of $800 for five years as a basic universal income.

### Youth (Under 20)
- **25%**: $104,000 in family-controlled business and housing.
- $400 weekly direct payments.
- **50%**: $208,000 in trust reserved for future access in housing, education, or business investments.

## Immediate Societal Impact

1. **Zero National Debt**: All outstanding public financial obligations are wiped clean.
2. **Five-Year Government Security**: Public services operate without financial strain.
3. **Universal Income**: Every adult receives guaranteed income, housing, and business equity.
4. **Work by Choice**: Employment becomes a choice centered around passion rather than necessity.
5. **Reduced Crime**: Economic stability removes motives for common criminal acts, transforming social dynamics.

By addressing the root financial precursors to societal problems such as crime, violence, and instability, this solution fosters an environment where abundance can thrive, replacing systemic issues enabled by scarcity.

This bold approach demands not just economic planning but a collective commitment to redesign Australian society into one of sustained prosperity for every citizen.
